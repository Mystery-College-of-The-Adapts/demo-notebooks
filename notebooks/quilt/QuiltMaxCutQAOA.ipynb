    "# Improving the performance of Max-Cut QAOA with Quil-T\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to run the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm** (QAOA) on Aspen-8, using features of **Quil-T** to disable global fencing on CZ gates and, in doing so, improve the fidelity of the algorithm. This extends the ``MaxCutQAOA.ipynb`` notebook provided to our Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) users.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fence is a barrier in time used to sequence operations at the pulse control level. To minimize crosstalk on 2-qubit (2Q) gates, global fencing is normally enabled, meaning that each 2Q pulse sequence is applied with no other operations occurring on the QPU. While this maximizes the fidelity of any single 2Q gate, it also limits the total 2Q gate depth that can be achieved within the coherence time of the system. For shallow circuits less than 10x 2Q gates, this is certainly the right choice. However, for deep circuits greater than about 20x 2Q gates, it can be that disabling fencing provides a net improvement in fidelity for specific applications. We will demonstrate this effect in the context of a Max-Cut problem run using QAOA."
