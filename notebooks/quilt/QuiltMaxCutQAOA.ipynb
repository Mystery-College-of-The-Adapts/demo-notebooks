    "# Max-Cut QAOA with Quil-T\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will walk through how to run the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm** (QAOA) on the Aspen-8 QPU, using features of **Quil-T** to disable global fencing on CZ gates. This extends the QAOA demonstration shown in the ``MaxCutQAOA.ipynb`` notebook, with basic operations consolidated and new sections focusing on Quil-T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fencing is used to sequence operations in time at the pulse control level. To minimize crosstalk on 2Q gates, global fencing is normally enabled, meaning that each 2Q gate is applied with no other operations occurring on the QPU. While this maximizes the fidelity of any single 2Q gate, it also limits the total 2Q gate depth that can be achieved within the coherence time of the system. For shallow circuits less than 10x 2Q gates, this is certainly the right choice. However, for deep circuits greater than 20x 2Q gates, it can be that disabling fencing provides a net improvement in fidelity for specific applications. We will demonstrate this effect in the context of a Max-Cut problem run using QAOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This notebook depends on your JupyterLab environment being configured to use the **Quil-T SDK**, and only runs on QPU. If the following set of imports fails, it is possible you are running in the wrong environment."
